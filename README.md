### Getting Started

This boilerplate was built as a template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) and includes options to customize your final scaffolded app. The use of `node@^7` or higher required. electron-vue also officially recommends the [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.org) package manager as it handles dependencies much better and can help reduce final build size with `yarn clean`.

```bash
# Install vue-cli and scaffold boilerplate
npm install -g vue-cli
vue init kdydesign/vue-electron my-project
```
